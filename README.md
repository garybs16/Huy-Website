# Allegiance Career Institute Rough Draft (React)

This is a rough one-page React mirror of:

`https://allegiancecareer-institute.com/`

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- Built with React + Vite.
- Uses live image assets from the source website for visual similarity.
- Content and layout are drafted to match key sections quickly (hero, programs, fees, schedule, testimonials, contact, footer).
